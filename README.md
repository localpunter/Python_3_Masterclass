# What's this course all about?

✔ Python 3 programming course aimed at anyone having little or no experience in coding and a great desire to start learning Python
from scratch. This hands-on training takes you from "Hello World!" to advanced Python topics in just a few hours.

✔ First, you will learn and practice every Python 3 key concept, which is explained in one or more video lectures,
usually followed by a short quiz and several exercises.

✔ Each video is filled with relevant examples, created in a learn-by-doing fashion and the quizzes,
coding exercises and assignments will help you consolidate the main ideas behind each Python 3 topic.

✔ After laying the foundation, you will start exploring some advanced Python 3 topics, thus quickly growing your skills
from Zero to Beginner to Intermediate to Advanced to Superhero level.

✔ Next, we will build a scientific calculator in Python 3, having a basic user menu and both simple and
advanced math operations available: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, raising to a power,
square root, logarithm, as well as trigonometric functions like sin, cos and tan.

✔ Finally, you will gain some real-life skills that you can use at most programming and IT-related jobs:
Excel Automation, Database Automation and Network Automation, among others, using Python 3.

✔ You will also be able to download printable cheat sheets to have every Python 3 concept at hand whenever you need it,
as well as a 200+ pages Python 3 e-book that can help you continue studying whenever you don't feel like watching videos
or solving coding exercises. What more can you ask for?

✔ As a final bonus, you will also get all the Python 2 content in my older course, so you will be able to interact
with systems still running the legacy "edition" of Python, which have not yet migrated to the latest version.
It never hurts to be fluent in both versions of this amazingly popular programming language,
although Python 3 is the most relevant version today.
