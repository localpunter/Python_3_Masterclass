Signing Up to the Arista Software Download Portal

When you're trying to sign up for a new Arista account you will receive a message.

You can hit Cancel as per the instructions in that message to sign up as a guest. Then simply choose Guest on the next screen and finally activate your account using the link in the e-mail that Arista will send to you.

You may be required to wait for 5 minutes after confirming your account in order to be able to log in.

Then, simply go to the EOS Download section at https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download and search for the necessary files, as shown in the previous video. Note that you may also be redirected to this page after you login to your new account.

Now you're good to go.
